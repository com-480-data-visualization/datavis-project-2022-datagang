## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

_(max. 2000 characters per section)_

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

Food is a major concern wordlwide and it is problem that is expected to get even worse year by year due to global warming and climate concerns. Nowadays, one-third of our greenhouse gas emissions comes from the agriculture sector. The world population is expected to grow by 2 billion in 2050, and feeding the world has become an increasingly concerning problem. Still, a big part of the grain harvested goes towards the meat industry, to feed livestocks. One of the main reasons is that over the past 50 years, our meat production has almost quadrupled - implying needs for more and more resources.

Our goal in this project will be to visualize the share of produced food that goes towards the breeding industry, and what is used to actually feed citizens. We would like to show that the amount of food dedicated to producing meat is way to big and that it could be used differently if we choose to adapt our diet a bit to at least reduce the amount of meat we eat. We think it is a very important and meaningful topic in today's era. We would like to make this information easily accessible and easy to visualize for everybody, without requiring any background knowledge on the topic.

To do so, we plan to visualize on a map the quantities of food each country exports and imports, and then to have detailed plots for every country showing the amount of food dedicated to livestocks, and the amount of food dedicated to citizens. For every country, we will also have access to data regarding the most consumed types of food as well as how well inhabitants are nourished. This visualization should be able to help us pinpoint problems about food repartition, e.g. countries starving but exporting lots of grains, or countries that dedicate a too high share of what they produce to breeding livestock. We also want to build an overall tendency by averaging the data world-wide to have a broad overview of the topic. We also want to show how this trend evolved over the years.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
>
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

We don't know of any data visualization projects using this dataset, but there are some research papers linked to it focusing on the sustainability aspect (https://edepot.wur.nl/532420).
A kaggle entry also uses a subset of this dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production). There are quite a lot of data analysis made, but not much visualizations.
We don't plan to reuse any of these visualizations, but they can provide some overview of the dataset.
Some examples of visualizations realised on this dataset are:

- Production Visualization on a World Map - https://www.kaggle.com/code/kumarpranay/production-visualization-on-a-world-map
- Who eats what we grow ? - https://www.kaggle.com/code/preetmehta/who-eat-what-we-grow
- The visualization available on the data provider website - https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBSH/visualize

Even if our approach is not revolutionary in the data visualization world, our main goal is to make our visualization as interactive as possible to make the data accessible and fun to interact with. We want to really focus on the simplicity of use to convey our message in an effective way.

[TODO Inspirations]

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
