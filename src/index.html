        <div>
          Our Food Balance Sheet dataset contains four important features:
          <ol>
            <li>
              the quantity of food supplied as well as consumed by either people
              (noted as ‚Äúfood‚Äù) or livestock (noted as ‚Äúfeed‚Äù)
            </li>
            <li>
              The aforementioned quantity of food specified by different food
              types
            </li>

            <li>The aforementioned quantity of food by different countries</li>
            <li>All across different years.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
          In light of this, two questions arise naturally: <br />

          <ol>
            <li>How much food is consumed by people or by livestock?</li>
            <li>What are the dominant types of food in each case?</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="header-section">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0px">The problem</h3>
        <div>
          Food is a major concern wordlwide and it is problem that is expected
          to get even worse year by year due to global warming and climate
          concerns. Nowadays, one-third of our greenhouse gas emissions comes
          from the agriculture sector. The world population is expected to grow
          by 2 billion in 2050, and feeding the world has become an increasingly
          concerning problem. Still, a big part of the grain harvested goes
          towards the meat industry, to feed livestocks. One of the main reasons
          is that over the past 50 years, our meat production has almost
          quadrupled - implying needs for more and more resources.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Our goal in this project will be to visualize the share of produced
          food that goes towards the breeding industry, and what is used to
          actually feed citizens. We would like to show that the amount of food
          dedicated to producing meat is way to big and that it could be used
          differently if we choose to adapt our diet a bit to at least reduce
          the amount of meat we eat.

            Using this interactive map, you can visualize data for the entire
            world. For every country, you can how well people are fed, how much
            food goes towards feeding people and how much goes towards feeding
            livestock. Using the slider at the bottom of the map, you can access
            data for every year recorded. On the side you can see a few charts
            containing global aggregates. <br /><br />Click on any country to
            have more detailed information about it!

        <div class="header-section">
          <h3 style="margin-top: 0px">What does it show?</h3>
          <div>
            The most striking thing to do is to switch between the "Food" and
            "Feed" modes. We purposefully kept the same color scale for both
            modes. It shows quite evidently the insane amount of food that is
            redirected towards livestock instead of actual people. For instance,
            the United States uses 100 times more food to feed livestock than
            humans!<br />
            It is interesting to see that this trend mostly applies to richer
            countries, the poorer ones tend to have less proportion gap. Our
            charts on the right also show quite evidently that we have way more
            food than needed in the world, the main problem is how it is
            repartited.

        These charts display the proportions of every type of food used for food
        (feeding humans) and deef (feeding cattle). We can (hopefully!) see
        disparities in the most represented types of food.
